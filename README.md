# Queueing System Simulation: M/M/1, M/G/1, and G/M/1
This project simulates three fundamental single-server queueing models — M/M/1, M/G/1, and G/M/1 — using discrete-event simulation with SimPy. It explores how different inter-arrival and service time distributions affect system performance metrics such as response time, waiting time, and server utilization. The simulation results are visualized to compare the behavior of exponential, general, and deterministic processes under varying load conditions.
