# Queueing System Simulation: M/M/1, M/G/1, and G/M/1
This project simulates three fundamental single-server queueing models — M/M/1, M/G/1, and G/M/1 — using continuous-time discrete-event simulation with SimPy. It explores how different combinations of inter-arrival and service time distributions impact key system performance metrics such as:
- Average response time
- Average waiting time
- Server utilization

Each experiment simulates a large number of clients and varies the arrival rate λ to observe system behavior under different traffic intensities. The results are visualized to compare the effects of variability in arrival and service processes on overall queue performance.
